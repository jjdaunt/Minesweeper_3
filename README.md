# Minesweeper_3
Angular Minesweeper!

If you want to run this offline, change the commented out script tag to the one sourcing angular from the Google CDN and uncomment the local script source.

You'll need a copy of Angular, this was made on 1.6.4: https://code.angularjs.org/1.6.4/angular.min.js

Possible future features if I stop being lazy:

How to Play Minesweeper section

Actual colour picker

Actual styling + dynamic name sizing

Bar graph animations

Endgame Stats
